# imitation-inhibition-pictures

These are the pictures used for the online imitation-inhibition task. To avoid any modification (renaming etc.), this repository is also archived. The pictures can also be found on the [OSF of the online task](https://osf.io/q7fju/). 

The pictures are, for example, the original pictures from the first imitation-inhibition task by Brass et al. (2000). But also mirrored pictures of these and other pictures.
